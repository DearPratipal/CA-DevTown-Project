🌐 Introduction to HTML
What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create the structure of web pages by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

Why HTML?
HTML is essential because it provides the basic structure of websites, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

How does HTML Work?
HTML uses tags to mark up elements in a document. Tags are enclosed within angle brackets, like <h1> for a heading or <p> for a paragraph. Each HTML element usually comes with an opening tag <tag> and a closing tag </tag>.

Who Developed HTML?
HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 as a way to structure documents on the World Wide Web (WWW). It was the first version of HTML and laid the foundation for web development.

The Role of W3C
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an organization that standardizes and maintains the guidelines for HTML and other web technologies. W3C ensures that web pages and browsers can understand and render HTML correctly.

HTML Is Not a Programming Language
Some students mistakenly believe that HTML is a programming language, but that’s not true. HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It is used to structure content, not to perform logical operations or calculations like programming languages.

🔗 Hyperlinking HTML Pages
Hyperlinks are a key feature of HTML, allowing users to navigate between different web pages. Use the <a> tag to create links:

html
Copy code
<a href="page2.html">Go to Page 2</a>
The code above will create a clickable link that takes the user from the current page to page2.html.

📝 Markup Language Explained
A markup language is a way of annotating a document so that it can be correctly displayed in a browser. HTML uses tags to define different elements, such as:

Opening tag: <tag>
Closing tag: </tag>
Tags help the browser understand how to display content, where to place text, images, links, and other elements on a web page.
